# MS_FHE_WORKSPACE
Fully Homomorphic Encryption Project Workspace

> **1_Research**

✅ 1. I worked on SEAL FHE using Microsoft Visual Studio C++ tool.\
✅ 2. I got a cmake error with MSVC++ 2022. The cmake script is using the ***config.h.in*** file as guarded. But other code files are accessed with the name ***config.h***. I've been working on it looking for a solution.\
✅ 3. I compiled the seal library with MSVC++ 2019 and produced the lib file. There is a compiler version difference with MSVC++ 2022. That's why I made my productions in  MSVC++ 2019.\
✅ 4. After generating the vector data from the raw image data, I will look into the comparison algorithms.\
